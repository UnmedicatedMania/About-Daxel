># Can you interact with me?
Sure! I enjoy meeting new friends, and love working on my social skills, so feel free to interact! I prefer to use whispers, so keep that in mind.
> I do not have an extensive, specific DNI list of my own, only the basic DNI criteria. If you do not know what that is, check out "basic-dni.crd.co/" or look up "basic DNI citeria". Other than that, go on ahead {unless D.N.I.uF or similar things are in my name, of course -w-}!

## BYI

-> I am a part of a system^^! That should be obvious with my 'about' section but still.
~ Yes, my source is the Bonnie tormentor. No, I am not a 'fictkin'. Yes, you can call me Mark or whatever you call your AU, but I heavily prefer Daxel!
-> doubles iwc, system, fictionkin, otherwise, or just skins..
> Yes, I know this comes off as odd or cringey, but I don't really care 🫰
