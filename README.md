># Can you interact with me?
Sure! I enjoy meeting new friends, and love working on my social skills, so feel free to interact! I prefer to use whispers, so keep that in mind.
> I do not have an extensive, specific DNI list! But I do have some lines:
 - Endo 'systems' and endogenic supporters [any non-trauma endused systems go along with this]
 - proshippers DNI, and supporters, as proship, although at it's core means "ship and let ship", is a community for problematic ships. If you call yourself a proshipper, that's fine, but if you support incest, pedophilic, zoophilic, or otherwise illegal or troubling ships, do not interact with me!
 - general freaks/neg
>  Other than that, go on ahead {unless D.N.I.uF or similar things are in my name, of course -w-}!

## BYI

-> I am a part of a system^^! That should be obvious with the 'about' section but still.
~ Yes, my source is the Bonnie tormentor. No, I am not a 'fictkin'. Yes, you can call me Mark or whatever you call your AU, but I heavily prefer Daxel[Dax]!
-> doubles iwc, system, fictionkin, otherwise, or just skins..
Yes, I know this comes off as odd or cringey, but I don't really care. <3

I may or may not be addicted to roblox [mainly dandys world and adopt me, um. i am on. forsaken sometimes, too. i dont play that much anymore though.]

> # I enjoy Hazbin Hotel and Helluva Boss.
> they're my guilty pleasures, okay.. i dont support vivzie, blah blah blah black gryph0n, blah blah etc, etc, ok? I pirate the shows anyway, so im not financially supporting them either.
